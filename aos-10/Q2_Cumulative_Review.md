# Q2 Cumulative Review

Here are some sample problems. This isn't exhaustive but should give you an idea of the breadth of the
quiz and the types of questions.

### Unit Circle

1. $\sin 5\pi/6$, $\cot \pi$, $\cos 9\pi/4$, careful with 0 vs undefined! denominator = 0 is undefined.

### All 6 Trig functions in all 4 quadrants

3. If $\sin \theta = -1/2$ and $\theta$ is in the third quadrant what is $\cos \theta$
4. If $\cos \theta = \sqrt{3}/2$ and $\theta$ is in the fourth quadrant what is $\cos(2\theta)$

### Triangles

1. The point (4,3) is on the terminal side of an angle in standard position. Determine the value of all 6 trig functions of the angle.
2. The point (-9,-11) is on the terminal side of an angle in standard position. Determine the value of all 6 trig functions of the angle.

### SohCahToa

1. In right triangle $ACB$, $C$ is a right angle and $A = \pi/3$. If $b=9\sqrt{3}$ find $a$.

### Law of Sines

1. In triangle $ABC$, if $A = 40^{\circ}$ and $B = 80^\circ$ and $a = 12$, find $b$ (calc)
2. In triangle $ABC$, if $A = 40^{\circ}$ and $b = 23$ and $a = 12$, find $B$ (calc)

### Law of Cosines

1. In triangle $ABC$ if $a=10$ and $b=12$ and $C=43^\circ$, find $c$
2. In triangle $ABC$ if $a=10$ and $b=12$ and $c=17.5$, find $C$
3. Why does $a=5, b=10, c=20$ have no solution?

### Trig Equations

1. Using inverse trig functions to solve for $x$:
  * Solve $\sin x = -\sqrt3/2$. Solve $\csc x = 2$. Solve $\cot x = \infty$.
	* Remember if $\sin(\theta) = 1/2$, you can replace this with $y(\theta) = 1/2$.  Where on the unit circle is $y = 1/2$? (answer is $\pi/6$ and $5\pi/6$.)
	* Similarly for $\cos \theta$ and $x(\theta)$.
	* Tangent is $y/x$ which is the slope. So where is the slope of a line from the center to the unit circle point equal to the given value?
2. Finding all solutions (e.g. all solution on unit circle. There's almost always 2 at least)
3. Finding general solutions (take solution(s) and add $2k\pi$ for sin/cos and $k\pi$ for tan)
	* Find the general solution to $2\sqrt{2}\sin(x) = -\sqrt{6}$.
	* Find the general solution to $\tan^2(x) = 3$
	* Find the general solution to $\tan^2(3x) = 3$


### Trig Graphing
Amplitude, Phase Shift, Vertical Shift, Period

  * y = $A\sin(B(x+C)) + D$ has amplitude $A$, phase shift $-C$, vertical shift $D$ and period $2\pi/B$
  * y = $D + A\sin(B(x+C))$ is the same!
  * $\tan$ has period $\pi/B$
  * Match graph to equation
  * Write equation from graph and/or properties
  	* Write a $\sin$ function with amplitude $5$ and period $4$
  	* Write a $\tan$ function with period $\pi/5$ and vertical shift $-2$

	* Domain Range of $\sin \cos \tan$. Remember domain restrictions when $\tan x$ is undefined.


### Trig Identities

  * Addition and Subtraction Identities
  * Double angle identities
  * Reciprocal Identities
  * Pythagorean identities
  * No proofs, but know valid steps
  * Problems like $\sin(15^\circ)$ and $\cos(7\pi/{12})$ which you get from using identities on the unit circle.

### Conics
(review using your recent notes!)

  * Equations of Circle and Ellipse
  * Center, Radius, Vertex, Focus, Major/Minor Axis
  * Matching graph to equation / Write equation given information
  * Questions like quiz questions

### In general

	* Calc and non-calc questions
	* Multiple Choice / Matching
