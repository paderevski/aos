# Introduction to Vectors with Examples

## What is a Vector?

A vector is a mathematical object that has both magnitude and direction. It is often represented by an arrow, where the arrow’s length indicates the magnitude, and the arrow’s direction indicates the direction of the vector.

### Example:
Consider an arrow pointing from the origin (0,0) to the point (4,3) in a 2D coordinate system. This arrow represents a vector $\vec{a}$ with magnitude and direction. The magnitude can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem, and the direction is towards the point (4,3) from the origin.

## Representing Vectors

Vectors are commonly represented in coordinate notation as $\langle x, y \rangle$ in two dimensions or $\langle x, y, z \rangle$ in three dimensions.

### Example:
- A 2D vector: $\vec{a} = \langle 3, 4 \rangle$
- A 3D vector: $\vec{b} = \langle 1, -2, 2 \rangle$

## Basic Operations

### Addition and Subtraction

Vectors are added or subtracted by combining or subtracting their respective components.

#### Example - Addition:
Given $\vec{a} = \langle 3, 4 \rangle$ and $\vec{b} = \langle 1, 2 \rangle$,
$\vec{a} + \vec{b} = \langle 3 + 1, 4 + 2 \rangle = \langle 4, 6 \rangle$.

#### Example - Subtraction:
Given $\vec{a} = \langle 3, 4 \rangle$ and $\vec{b} = \langle 1, 2 \rangle$,
$\vec{a} - \vec{b} = \langle 3 - 1, 4 - 2 \rangle = \langle 2, 2 \rangle$.

### Magnitude

The magnitude of a vector is found using the square root of the sum of the squares of its components.

#### Example:
For $\vec{a} = \langle 3, 4 \rangle$,
Magnitude $|\vec{a}| = \sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{9 + 16} = \sqrt{25} = 5$.

### Direction

The direction of a vector can be described by the angle it makes with the positive x-axis.

#### Example:
For $\vec{a} = \langle 3, 4 \rangle$,
$\theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{4}{3}\right)$. This angle corresponds to the direction of $\vec{a}$.

### Unit Vectors

A unit vector has a magnitude of 1 and points in the direction of the original vector.

#### Example:
For $\vec{a} = \langle 3, 4 \rangle$, with magnitude $|\vec{a}| = 5$,
The unit vector $\hat{a}$ is $\frac{\vec{a}}{|\vec{a}|} = \frac{\langle 3, 4 \rangle}{5} = \langle \frac{3}{5}, \frac{4}{5} \rangle$.

## Practical Applications

Vectors are essential in physics for representing forces, velocities, and more, each of which has magnitude and direction.

### Example in Physics:
A force of 10 N (newtons) acting at an angle of 30° from the horizontal can be represented as a vector showing both the magnitude (10 N) and the direction (30° from horizontal).

## Conclusion

Vectors form the foundation for understanding many physical phenomena and mathematical concepts. Through examples, we've explored how vectors represent quantities with both magnitude and direction, how to perform basic operations with them, and their significance in various applications.

This enhanced introduction with examples should help in grasping the fundamental concepts of vectors, making it easier to tackle problems related to vector addition, subtraction, magnitude, direction, and unit vectors.
