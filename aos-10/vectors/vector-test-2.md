Here's a new vector math test tailored to your specifications, utilizing both bracket notation $\langle x, y \rangle$ and unit vector notation $a\hat{i} + b\hat{j}$. The test progresses through addition and subtraction, includes combined operations, moves on to magnitudes and unit vectors, tests understanding of vector direction, requires constructing vectors from given lengths and directions, assesses the concept of perpendicularity, and concludes with finding specific vectors relative to another.

#### Problem 18: Adding Forces in Engineering

A crane is lifting a heavy load with two cables. The first cable applies a force of 400 N directly upwards, represented by $\vec{F}_1 = 400\hat{j}$ N. The second cable applies a force at an angle of 30 degrees to the horizontal, with a magnitude of 300 N.

**a)** Represent the second force, $\vec{F}_2$, in component form using $\hat{i}$ and $\hat{j}$.

**b)** Calculate the total force exerted by the two cables on the load in component form.

**c)** Determine the magnitude and direction of the total force.

A plane aims to fly directly north at an airspeed of 250 km/h. However, there's a wind blowing from the west at 60 km/h.

**a)** Represent the plane's velocity as a vector, $\vec{V}_p$, and the wind's velocity as a vector, $\vec{V}_w$, in component form.

**b)** Calculate the plane's actual velocity relative to the ground, $\vec{V}_g$, taking into account the wind's effect.

**c)** Determine the plane's actual speed and direction of travel relative to the ground.

#### Problem 20: Boat Going Down a River

A boat wants to cross a river that is 500 meters wide. The river's current flows southward at a speed of 3 km/h, and the boat can travel at a speed of 8 km/h relative to the water.

**a)** If the boat aims to reach the exact opposite point on the other bank, at what angle (to the west of north) must it head?

**b)** Represent the boat's intended velocity in the water, $\vec{V}_b$, and the river's current, $\vec{V}_r$, in component form.

**c)** Calculate how long it will take for the boat to cross the river and the actual distance downstream it will have landed from its starting point.

For these problems, students are encouraged to use vector addition to find resultant vectors, decompose vectors into their components for calculation, and apply trigonometry to find magnitudes and directions. These practical scenarios not only test their understanding of vector arithmetic but also illustrate the real-world applicability of vectors in physics and engineering.
