# Vector Word Problems

#### Problem 1: Adding Forces in Engineering

A crane is lifting a heavy load with two cables. The first cable applies a force of 400 N an an angle of 20 degrees to the left of vertical, represented by $\vec{F}_1 = 400\hat{j}$ N. The second cable applies a force at an angle of 30 degrees from the right, with a magnitude of 300 N.

**a)** Sketch a free-body diagram and represent the forces, $\vec{F}_1$, $\vec{F}_2$, in component form using $\hat{i}$ and $\hat{j}$.

**b)** Write a formula for the resultant vector $\vec{R}$ in terms of the other vectors. Then calculate the total force exerted by the two cables on the load in component form.

**c)** Determine the magnitude and direction of the total force.

#### Problem 2: Plane Flying in the Wind

A plane aims to fly directly north at an airspeed of 250 km/h. However, there's a wind blowing 32 degrees south of west at 60 km/h.

**a)** Sketch a picture and represent the plane's velocity as a vector, $\vec{V}_p$, and the wind's velocity as a vector, $\vec{V}_w$, in component form.

**b)** Write a formula for the plane's actual velocity relative to the ground, $\vec{V}_g$ in terms of the other vectors. Calculate this vector, taking into account the wind's effect.

**c)** Determine the plane's actual speed and direction of travel relative to the ground.

#### Problem 3: Boat Going Down a River

A boat wants to cross a river that is 500 meters wide. The river's current flows southward at a speed of 3 km/h, and the boat can travel at a speed of 8 km/h relative to the water. The boat aims to reach the exact opposite point on the other bank.

**a)** Draw a picture and write the 3 relevant vectors. Express one vector as function of the other two.

**b)** At what angle (to the west of north) must it head?

**c)** Calculate how long it will take for the boat to cross the river and the actual distance downstream it will have landed from its starting point.
