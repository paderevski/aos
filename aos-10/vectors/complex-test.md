Great! Based on your preferences, I'll create a 20-question test on complex numbers, focusing mostly on medium difficulty level questions, with a majority being short answer and a couple of problem-solving ones. The test will cover both rectangular and polar representations without particular emphasis on either, calculators are allowed for all questions, and we won't specifically include real-world applications. Let's get started:

### Complex Numbers Test: Pre-Calculus Level

#### Rectangular and Polar Representation

**Question 1**: Write the complex number $8 + 6i$ in polar form.

**Question 2**: If $z = 3 - 4i$, find the magnitude of $z$.

**Question 3**: Simplify the expression $(2 + 3i) + (4 - 5i)$.

**Question 4**: Multiply the complex numbers $2 + i$ and $3 - 2i$, and present your answer in rectangular form.

**Question 5**: Given $z = 4e^{i\frac{\pi}{6}}$, express $z$ in rectangular form.

**Question 6**: If $z = 1 + i\sqrt{3}$, find and simplify $z^2$.

**Question 7**: Divide $10 - 2i$ by $2 + i$, and express your answer in the form $a + bi$.

**Question 8**: Find the conjugate of the complex number $5 - 3i$.

**Question 9**: Calculate the argument of the complex number $-3 + 3i$.

**Question 10**: If $z = 7e^{i\theta}$ and $|z| = 7$, find $\theta$.

**Question 11**: Express the sum $(6e^{i\pi/4}) + (2e^{i\pi/3})$ in polar form.

**Question 12**: For $z = -4 + 4i$, convert $z$ to polar form and find its principal argument.

**Question 13**: Simplify the product $e^{i\pi/2} \cdot e^{i\pi/4}$.

**Question 14**: Given $z = 9 - 9i$, normalize $z$ (i.e., find the unit vector in the direction of $z$).

**Question 15**: If $z_1 = 4 + 4i$ and $z_2 = 4e^{i\pi/4}$, show that $z_1$ and $z_2$ represent the same point in the complex plane.

**Problem-Solving Questions**

**Question 16**: Solve the equation $z^2 + 4z + 13 = 0$ for $z$ and express your answers in rectangular form.

**Question 17**: If $z = a + bi$ satisfies the equation $|z - (3 - i)| = 2$, find one possible value of $a$ and $b$.

**Question 18**: Given the complex numbers $z_1 = 2e^{i\pi/3}$ and $z_2 = 3e^{-i\pi/6}$, find the product $z_1 \cdot z_2$ and express it in polar form.

**Question 19**: If $z^3 = 8i$, find all values of $z$ in polar form.

**Question 20**: Show that the complex numbers $z = re^{i\theta}$ and $w = re^{-i\theta}$ are conjugates of each other.

This test covers a range of topics on complex numbers, starting from basic operations in rectangular form, transitioning to polar representation, and ending with some problem-solving that requires a deeper understanding of the concepts. Remember, calculators are allowed, so students can focus on understanding the concepts rather than manual computation. Good luck!

Certainly! Here's the answer key for the Complex Numbers Test. Keep in mind, for some questions, especially those involving arguments or principal arguments, answers might vary slightly due to the nature of angles in polar representation.

**Question 18**: $6e^{i\pi/6}$

**Question 19**: $z = 2e^{i\pi/6}, 2e^{i5\pi/6}, 2e^{i9\pi/6}$ or equivalently $2e^{i\pi/6}, 2e^{i5\pi/6}, 2e^{-i\pi/6}$

**Question 20**: Yes, by definition of complex conjugates and properties of exponents.

Remember, the answers, especially for polar forms, might be presented differently based on the convention used (radians vs. degrees, for instance). Make sure to adapt the answers according to the instructional context and the level of precision expected from your students.
