This test covers a range of topics on complex numbers, starting from basic operations in rectangular form, transitioning to polar representation, and ending with some problem-solving that requires a deeper understanding of the concepts. Remember, calculators are allowed, so students can focus on understanding the concepts rather than manual computation. Good luck!

Certainly! Here's the answer key for the Complex Numbers Test. Keep in mind, for some questions, especially those involving arguments or principal arguments, answers might vary slightly due to the nature of angles in polar representation.
