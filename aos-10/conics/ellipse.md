# The Ellipse

The ellipse is, geometrically, a circle that has been stretched in the $x$ and/or $y$ directions. It has useful
reflection properties and is most famous, perhaps, for defining the shape of a closed orbit in a 2-body orbital system.

**Geometric Definition**: Given two fixed points in a plane, $F_1$ and $F_2$, and a constant $k > 0$, the ellipse is the locus of points $P$ in the same plane such that $||PF_1| + ||PF_2|| = k$. The line through $F_1$ and $F_2$ is the *major axis* of the ellipse. The two points $F_1,F_2$ are the *foci* (singular: *focus*) of the ellipse. The *minor axis* is perpendicular to the major axis. The 4 points at which the ellipse intersects an axis are the vertices.

**Parent Equation**: $\dfrac{x^2}{a^2}+\dfrac{y^2}{b^2}=1$ is the equation for an ellipse centered at the origin. The semi-major axis length is $\max(a,b)$ and the semi-minor axis length is $\min(a,b)$. (The major and minor axis lengths are twice the semi-major axis and semi-minor axis lengths.)

**General Equation**: $\dfrac{(x-h)^2}{a^2} + \dfrac{(y-k)^2}{b^2} = 1$ is an ellipse centered at $(h,k)$.

**Properties**

* Length of axes are $2a$ and $2b$. The longer one is the major axis.
* The distance from the center of the ellipse to either focus is $c$ where $c^2 = |a^2-b^2|$.
* The sum of the distances from any point to both foci is $\max(2a,2b)$
* The eccentricity of an ellipse is defined as $e = \dfrac{c}{a}$.
* The area of an ellipse is $\pi a b$.
* The perimeter of an ellipse is very complicated[^1]
* Any ray of light or sound which emanates from one focus will reflect to the other focus. You may have experienced this in the US Capitol's Whispering Gallery.

**Relation to a circle**. A circle is an ellipse with $a=b$. You can think of $a$ as the "x-radius" of the ellipse and $b$ as the "y-radius" of the ellipse. (These are not widely accepted terms, just mental aids).

**Parametric Equations**. An ellipse can be defined parametrically as the set of points $x = a \cos \theta, y = b \sin \theta$ for $\theta \in [0,2\pi)$. These equations trace the ellipse counterclockwise starting at the point $(b,0).$ Transforming these equations to a center of $(h,k)$ results in $x = h + a \cos \theta, y = k + b \sin \theta$.

**Polar Equation:** The polar equation for an ellipse is ...

(Note: this presentation differs from many texts which enforce that $a>b$ leading two 2 version of every equation and definition, one for tall ellipses and one for wide ellipses. This is silly. It's easier to say $a$ always goes with $x$ and the major axis goes with whichever of $a,b$ is larger.)

The average from the sun to the earth is defined as one astronomical units (AUs). Since the distance varies, there is a point when the earth is closest to the sun (perihelion) and furthest (aphelion).
    #. Using a reliable resource, determine the values of the distances at aphelion and perihelion for the Earth in AU.
    #. Using these value, write the equation of the Earth's orbit in standard form, where $x$ and $y$ are measured in units of AU. Assume the Sun is positioned to the right of the center of the ellipse, on the $x$-axis.

[^1]: If you really want to know, it's the value of the "complete elliptic integral of the second kind" $4a \int_0^{\pi/2} \sqrt{1 - e^2 \sin^2 \theta} \; d\theta$, which can be approximated by the series $p = \pi(a+b)\left(1 + \frac14 h + \frac{1}{64}h^2 + \frac{1}{256}h^3 + \ldots\right)$ where $h = \frac{(a-b)^2}{(a+b)^2}$
[^2]: It would be a perfect ellipse if it weren't for the moon, and Jupiter and, to a much smaller extent, all the other planets.
