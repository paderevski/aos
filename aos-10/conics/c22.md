**Problem Statement:**
Circle $C_1$ has a radius of 1 and is centered at the origin. Circle $C_2$ is tangent to circle $C_1$ at the point $(-\frac{\sqrt2}{2},-\frac{\sqrt2}{2})$, entirely contains circle $C_1$, and has twice the area of $C_1$. We need to write the equation of $C_2$ in standard form.

**Solution:**

1. **Determine the Radius of $C_2$**:
   - The area of $C_2$ is twice that of $C_1$. Since the area of a circle is $\pi r^2$, and the radius of $C_1$ ($r_1$) is 1, the radius of $C_2$ ($r_2$) can be found using $\pi \times 1^2 \times 2 = \pi r_2^2$.
   - Solving this gives $r_2 = \sqrt{2}$.

2. **Find the Center of $C_2$**:
   - Since $C_2$ is tangent to $C_1$ at $(-\frac{\sqrt2}{2}, -\frac{\sqrt2}{2})$ and contains $C_1$, its center must be along the line extending from the origin to the point of tangency, but in the opposite direction.
   - The center of $C_2$ is $\sqrt{2}$ units away from the origin in this direction. Given the symmetry and the tangency point, the center is at $(1 - \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}, 1 - \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2})$.

3. **Write the Equation of $C_2$**:
   - The standard form of a circle's equation is $(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2$, where $(h, k)$ is the center and $r$ is the radius.
   - Substituting $h = 1 - \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$, $k = 1 - \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$, and $r = \sqrt{2}$ gives the equation of $C_2$ as $(x - 1 + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2})^2 + (y - 1 + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2})^2 = 2$.

Therefore, the equation of circle $C_2$ in standard form is:

$(x - 1 + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2})^2 + (y - 1 + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2})^2 = 2$

This represents the circle with twice the area of $C_1$, tangent to $C_1$ at $(-\frac{\sqrt2}{2},-\frac{\sqrt2}{2})$, and enclosing $C_1$ completely.
