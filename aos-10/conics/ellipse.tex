\section{The Ellipse}\label{the-ellipse}}

The ellipse is, geometrically, a circle that has been stretched in the
\(x\) and/or \(y\) directions. It has useful reflection properties and
is most famous, perhaps, for defining the shape of a closed orbit in a
2-body orbital system.

\textbf{Geometric Definition}: Given two fixed points in a plane,
\(F_1\) and \(F_2\), and a constant \(k > 0\), the ellipse is the locus
of points \(P\) in the same plane such that \(||PF_1| + ||PF_2|| = k\).
The line through \(F_1\) and \(F_2\) is the \emph{major axis} of the
ellipse. The two points \(A,B\) are the \emph{foci} (singular:
\emph{focus}) of the ellipse. The \emph{minor axis} is perpendicular to
the major axis. The 4 points at which the ellipse intersects an axis are
the vertices.

\textbf{Parent Equation}: \(\dfrac{x^2}{a^2}+\dfrac{y^2}{b^2}=1\) is the
equation for an ellipse centered at the origin. The semi-major axis
length is \(\max(a,b)\) and the semi-minor axis length is \(\min(a,b)\).

\textbf{General Equation}:
\(\dfrac{(x-h)^2}{a^2} + \dfrac{(y-k)^2}{b^2} = 1\) is an ellipse
centered at \((h,k)\).

\textbf{Properties}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Length of axes are \(2a\) and \(2b\). The longer one is the major
  axis.
\item
  The distance from the center to either focus is \(c\) where
  \(c^2 = |a^2-b^2|\).
\item
  The sum of the distances from any point to both foci is
  \(\max(2a,2b)\)
\item
  The eccentricity of an ellipse is defined as \(e = \dfrac{c}{a}\).
\item
  The area of an ellipse is \(\pi a b\).
\item
  The perimeter of an ellipse is very complicated\footnote{If you really
    want to know, it's the value of the ``complete elliptic integral of
    the second kind''
    \(4a \int_0^{\pi/2} \sqrt{1 - e^2 \sin^2 \theta} \; d\theta\), which
    can be approximated by the series
    \(p = \pi(a+b)\left(1 + \frac14 h + \frac{1}{64}h^2 + \frac{1}{256}h^3 + \ldots\right)\)
    where \(h = \frac{(a-b)^2}{(a+b)^2}\)}
\item
  Any ray of light or sound which emanates from one focus will reflect
  to the other focus. You may have experienced this in the US Capitol's
  Whispering Gallery.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Relation to a circle}. A circle is an ellipse with \(a=b\). You
can think of \(a\) as the ``x-radius'' of the ellipse and \(b\) as the
``y-radius'' of the ellipse. (These are not widely accepted terms, just
mental aids).

\textbf{Parametric Equations}. An ellipse can be defined parametrically
as the set of points \(x = a \cos \theta, y = b \sin \theta\) for
\(\theta \in [0,2\pi)\). These equations trace the ellipse
counterclockwise starting at the point \((b,0).\) Transforming these
equations to a center of \((h,k)\) results in
\(x = h + a \cos \theta, y = k + b \sin \theta\).

\textbf{Polar Equation:} The polar equation for an ellipse is \ldots{}

(Note: this presentation differs from many texts which enforce that
\(a>b\) so there are 2 version of every equation and definition. This is
silly. It's easier to say \(a\) always goes with \(x\) and the major
axis goes with whichever of \(a,b\) is larger.)

  Statuary Hall is an elliptical room in the United States Capitol in
  Washington, D.C. The room is also called the Whispering Gallery

      perfect ellipse if it weren't for the moon, and Jupiter and, to a
      much smaller extent, all the other planets.}) elliptical orbit
    with the Sun at one focus. This is Kepler's Law. The average from
    the sun to the earth is defined as one astronomical units (AUs).
    Since the distance varies, there is a point when the earth is
    closest to the sun (perihelion) and furthest (aphelion).

    aphelion and perihelion for the Earth in AU.

    Using these value, write the equation of the Earth's orbit in
    standard form, where \(x\) and \(y\) are measured in units of AU.
    Assume the Sun is positioned to the right of the center of the
    ellipse, on the \(x\)-axis.
