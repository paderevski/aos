feet per second at an angle of 20Â° to the horizontal. The ball leaves
the pitcher's hand at a height of 4 feet above the ground.

1. [1pt] Find parametric equations that describe the motion of the ball as a
function of time. (Assume the ground has a $y$-coordinate of 0).
1. [1pt] How long is the ball in the air?

2. [1pt] At what time does the ball reach its maximum height?

3. [1pt] What is the maximum height of the ball?

4. [1pt] Determine the distance the ball travels.
