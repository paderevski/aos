## Free Response

A baseball pitcher throws a baseball with an initial speed of 138
feet per second at an angle of 20Â° to the horizontal. At time $t=0$, the ball leaves
the pitcher's hand at a height of 4 feet above the ground.

1. [1pt] Find four parametric equations that describe the position and velocity of the ball as a function of time. (Assume the ground has a $y$-coordinate of 0).

1. [1pt] Set up but do not solve an equation to answer: How long is the ball in the air? 

2. [1pt] Set up but do not solve an equation to answer: At what time does the ball reach its maximum height?

3. [1pt] What is the height of the ball after 5 seconds?

4. [1pt] Does the ball fly for more than 8 seconds?
