# Intro to Statistics - HW 4
## Z Scores

If $x$ is a data point in a normal distribution with
mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$,
then the **z-score** of $x$, given by

<center>

$Z = \dfrac{x-\mu}{\sigma}$

</center>

measures the number of standard deviations the number
$x$ is away from the mean. The mean of a normal distribution has z-score of $0$. In a distribution with $\mu=100$ and $\sigma=10$, the value $x$ would have a $Z$-score of 3 and a $Z$-score of -2.8 would correspond to the value 78.

## Exercises

These problems may proceed more quickly if you are able to type the answers.

1. Consult today's notes, and rewrite questions 1-8 to use
$Z$-scores instead of raw scores. The answers to your new questions should remain the same as the original answers.
2. Now rewrite your answers to questions 9-14 in terms of $Z$-scores instead of raw scores.
