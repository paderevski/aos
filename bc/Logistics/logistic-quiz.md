# Logistics

A population of kangaroos living in a kangaroo colony are growing according to a logistic model. The model is

$$P'(t) = kP(1-\dfrac{P}{1600})$$

a) Find the limit $\lim_{t \to \infty} P(t)$

b) Write the general solution to  the differential equation

c) if $P(0) = 100$ and $P(4) = 400$ find the particular solution to the differential equation

d) draw and label a graph for $P(t)$ below
