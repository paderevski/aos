# Test 6 Retake

Select appropriate problems (all the series is one option, the taylor question, and the interval question are 2 other options) based on what you missed on the first test.

## Convergence Tests (3pts each)

Prove convergence or divergence using appropriate tests. Show all relevant work and give precise jusitifications

1. $\displaystyle \sum_{n=1}^\infty \dfrac{n+1}{\sqrt{2n^3+1}}$
2. $\displaystyle \sum_{n=1}^\infty \dfrac{6}{2n+1}$
3. $\displaystyle \sum_{n=1}^\infty \dfrac{n!}{2^{2n+1}}$
4. $\displaystyle \sum_{n=1}^\infty n^2\dfrac{3}{2^n}$

For the following alternating series, additionally test for absolute convergence (4pts).

5. $\displaystyle \sum_{n=1}^\infty (-1)^{n+1}\dfrac{\sqrt{n+1}}{3n!}$

## Interval of Convergence (4 pts)

Give the interval of convergence for the following problem. You do not need to test endpoints.

6. $\displaystyle \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^n (2x-1)^n}{n^3}$


## Taylor Series (4 pts)

Write the Maclaurin Series for $f(x) = 3+2x\cos(3x^2)$, stopping after the 4th term. Your answer must use transformations from a known series.
