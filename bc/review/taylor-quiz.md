# Taylor Series Quiz

6. The function $f$ has a Taylor series about $x=1$ that converges to $f(x)$ for all $x$ in the interval of convergence. It is known that $f(1)=1, f^{\prime}(1)=-\frac{1}{2}$, and the $n$th derivative of $f$ at $x=1$ is given by $f^{(n)}(1)=(-1)^{n} \frac{(n-1) !}{2^{n}}$ for $n \geq 2$.

(a) Write the first four nonzero terms and the general term of the Taylor series for $f$ about $x=1$.

(b) The Taylor series for $f$ about $x=1$ has a radius of convergence of 2 . Find the interval of convergence. Show the work that leads to your answer.

(c) The Taylor series for $f$ about $x=1$ can be used to represent $f(1.2)$ as an alternating series. Use the first three nonzero terms of the alternating series to approximate $f(1.2)$.

(d) Show that the approximation found in part (c) is within 0.001 of the exact value of $f(1.2)$.
