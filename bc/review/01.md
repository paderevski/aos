## Limits, Continuity, and Differentiability Reference Page
## Existence of a Limit at a Point
A function $f(x)$ has a limit $L$ as $x$ approaches $C$ if and only if the left-hand and right-hand limits at $C$ exist and are equal.
1. $\lim _{x \rightarrow c^{-}} f(x)$ exists
2. $\lim _{x \rightarrow c^{+}} f(x)$ exists
3. $\lim _{x \rightarrow c^{-}} f(x)=\lim _{x \rightarrow c^{+}} f(x) \quad \therefore \lim _{x \rightarrow c} f(x)=L$
## Continuity
A function is continuous on an interval if it is continuous at every point of the interval. Intuitively, a function is continuous if its graph can be drawn without ever needing to pick up the pencil. This means that the graph of $y=f(x)$ has no "holes", no "jumps" and no vertical asymptotes at $x=a$. When answering free response questions on the AP exam, the formal definition of continuity is required. To earn all of the points on the free response question scoring rubric, all three of the following criteria need to be met, with work shown:
A function is continuous at a point $x=a$ if and only if:
1. $f(a)$ exists
2. $\lim _{x \rightarrow a} f(x)$ exists
3. $\lim _{x \rightarrow a} f(x)=f(a)$ (i.e., the limit equals the function value)
## Limit Definition of a Derivative
The derivative of a function $f(x)$ with respect to $x$ is the function $f^{\prime}(x)$ whose value at $x$ is $f^{\prime}(x)=\lim _{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}$, provided the limit exists.
## Alternative Form for Definition of a Derivative
The derivative of a function $f(x)$ at $x=a$ is $f^{\prime}(a)=\lim _{x \rightarrow a} \frac{f(x)-f(a)}{x-a}$, provided the limit exists.
## Continuity and Differentiability
Differentiability implies continuity (but not necessarily vice versa) If a function is differentiable at a point (at every point on an interval), then it is continuous at that point (on that interval). The converse is not always true: continuous functions may not be differentiable. It is possible for a function to be continuous at a specific value for $a$ but not differentiable there.
## L'Hospital's Rule (returns on 2017 AB exam)
Given that $f$ and $g$ are differentiable functions on an open interval $(a, b)$ containing $c$ (except possibly at $c$ itself), assume that $g^{\prime}(x) \neq 0$ for all $x$ in the interval (except possibly at $c$ itself).
If $\lim _{x \rightarrow c} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)}$ produces the indeterminate form $\frac{0}{0}$, then $\lim _{x \rightarrow c} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)}=\lim _{x \rightarrow c} \frac{f^{\prime}(x)}{g^{\prime}(x)}$ provided the limit on the right exists (or is infinite). This result also applies when the limit produces any one of the indeterminate forms $\frac{\infty}{\infty}, \frac{-\infty}{\infty}, \frac{\infty}{-\infty}$, or $\frac{-\infty}{-\infty}$.
