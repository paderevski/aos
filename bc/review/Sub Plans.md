After taking role, tell students to work in *pairs only* on the Series Packet (this was handed out before, pdf is on schoology). They should put up answers to problems 17-22. Give them time to complete the free response if they haven't completed already and tell them to put up and check those answers as well.

After 45 minutes or so (maybe less), hand out the Taylor Series packet (on or near my desk.) They should continue to work in pairs. After some time (30 minutes or so) they should up put up answers on the boards.

Tell them to check Schoology for more information. Remind them of quizzes next week and the test the week after.

Multiple choice answers to both packets are attached. Feel free to allow students to check answers *after* they have tried the problems.

Thank you!

p.s. Block 2 may have students late because of Research. I am used to this and don't require a pass from their teacher but please feel free to check up on them if you need to.
