# BC Review, Mostly Series


1. Write the general and first four terms of the Maclaurin series for $\sin x, \cos x, e^x, \ln(1+x)$
1. Let $f$ be a function having derivatives of all orders for all real numbers. The third-degree Taylor polynomial for $f$ about $x=2$ is given by $P_{3}(x)=7-9(x-2)^{2}-3(x-2)^{3}$.

2.  Suppose the fourth derivative of $f$ satisfies the inequality $\left|f^{(4)}(x)\right| \leq 6$ for all $x$ on the closed interval $[0,2]$. Use the Lagrange error bound to justify why $f(0)$ is negative.

3.  Find the Lagrange error in estimating $e \approx 1+1+\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{6}+\frac{1}{24}$

4.  Find the Lagrange error in estimating $\cos (0.3) \approx 1-\frac{(0.3)^{2}}{2 !}+\frac{(0.3)^{4}}{4 !}$
5.  Write the first four terms of the Maclaurin series for $f(x) = x^2 \sin(3x) - 4$
6.  Write the first four terms of the Maclaurin series for $f(x) =2x+ 3x \ln(x^2)$
7.  Evaluate: $\displaystyle \sum_{n=3}^\infty \dfrac{3^{n-2}}{4^{n+2}}$
7.  Evaluate: $\displaystyle \sum_{n=1}^\infty \dfrac{3^{2n-2}}{4^{n+2}}$
8.  Evaluate: $\displaystyle \sum_{n=0}^\infty {x^n}$ (hint: it's a geometric series)
9.  Evaluate: $\displaystyle \sum_{n=0}^\infty {(-1)^n}{x^n}$ (hint: it's a geometric series)
10. Take derivatives of both sides of 9. Then do the same to 10.
11. Evaluate: $\displaystyle \int\dfrac{2x+3}{x^2-7x+10} \; dx$
13. What's the formula for total distance traveled? Total displacement? In 1D and in 2D?
14. What is the arc length of the parabola $y=2x^2-5$ from $x=1$ to $x=4$? (Calculator can be used to integrate)
15. Evaluate $\displaystyle \int_0^\infty e^{-x}\;dx$
16. Evaluate $\displaystyle \int_0^1 \dfrac{e^x}{1-e^{x}}\;dx$
