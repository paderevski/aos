# Parametric Polar Quiz

The position of a particle moving in the $x y$-plane is given by the parametric equations $x(t)=\frac{6 t}{t+2}$ and $y(t)=\frac{-6}{t^{2}+4}$. What is the slope of the tangent line to the path of the particle at the point where $t=2$ ?

At time $t \geq 0$, a particle moving in the $x y$-plane has velocity vector given by
$v(t)=\left\langle 4 e^{-t}, \sin (2-\sqrt{t})\right\rangle$. What is the total distance the particle travels between $t=1$ and $t=3$ ?

The position of a particle moving in the $x y$-plane is given by the parametric equations $x=\frac{4 t^3}{3}-6 t^2$ and $y=2 t^3-6 t^2-18 t$. For what value(s) of $t$ is the particle at rest?

What is the slope of the line tangent to the polar curve $r=1-2 \sin \theta$ at $\theta=0$ ?

What is the area inside the polar curve $r=2 \sin \theta$ and outside the polar curve $r=\sin \theta$ ?
