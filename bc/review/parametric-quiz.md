1. A curve is defined by the parametric equations $x(t)=3 e^{2 t}$ and $y(t)=e^{3 t}-1$. What is $\frac{d^{2} y}{d x^{2}}$ in terms of $t$ ?

2. A particle moves on a plane curve so that at any time $t>0$ its $x$ - coordinate is $t^{3}-t$ and its $y$-coordinate is $(2 t-1)^{3}$. The acceleration vector of the particle at $t=1$ is

3. What is the slope of the line tangent to the polar curve $r=1+2 \sin \theta$ at $\theta=0$ ?

4. The area of the region inside the polar curve $r=4 \sin \theta$ and outside the polar curve $r=2$ is given by

5. The function $r$ satisfies $\frac{d r}{d \theta}=3 \sin \theta+3 \theta \cos \theta$. For $0 \leq \theta \leq 2 \pi$, find the value of $\theta$ that gives the point on the graph that is farthest from the origin. Justify your answer.
