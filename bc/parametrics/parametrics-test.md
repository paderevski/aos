1. At time $t \geq 0$, a particle moving in the $xy$-plane has velocity vector given by $v(t)=\langle t^2,5t \rangle$.
   1. What is the acceleration vector of the particle at time $t=3$?
   2. What is the speed of the particle at time $t=2$?
   3. If the initial position at time $t=0$ is $(1,2)$, find the position of the particle at time $t=4$
   4. What distance is covered by the particle from time $t=0$ to time $t=4$?

2. Write an integral expression for the length of the path described by $x(t) = \sin(t^3)$ and $y(t) = e^{3t}$ from $t=0$ to $t=\pi$
3. The position of a particle moving in the $xy$-plane is given by the vector $\langle 4t^3, y(2t) \rangle$
At time $t=\frac12$, what is the acceleation vector of the particle?
4. If $x(t) = t^2+4$ and $y(t) = t^4 + 3$ for any $t>0$ then what is $\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}$ in terms of $t$?
5. A particle moves in the $xy$-plane so that its position for $t \geq 0$ is given by $x(t) = \ln(t+1)$ and $y = kt^2$, for some positive constant $k$. The tangent line to the particle's path at the point where $t=3$ has slope 8. What is the value of $k$?
6. A particle moves on a plane curve such that at any time t > 0, its x-coordinate is $t-t^2+t^3$ while its $y$-coordinate is $(2-t^2)^2$. Find the magnitude of the particleâ€™s acceleration at $t = 1.$
7. The position of an object moving in the xy-plane with position function $f(t) = \langle 1+ \sin t,t + \cos t\rangle$, for $t \geq 0$. What is the maximum speed attained by the object?
8. A particle moves along the path $f(t) = \langle 2t^{3/2}, 3t-1 \rangle$, for $t \geq 0$. What is the average speed (average rate of change) of the particle from time $t=0$ to time $t=3$?
9. If $x(t) = 3t^2 - 4$ and $y(t) = e^{2t}-1$, write $y$ as a function of $x$ when $t \geq 2$.
10. Using the fifth-degree Taylor polynomial for $\sin x$, what is the error in approximating $\sin(1)$ by $P_5(1)$? That is, give an upper bound on $|P_5(1) - \sin(1)|$.
