# Parametrics Quiz 2

1. Find $\dfrac{dy}{dx}$ and $\dfrac{dy^2}{dx^2}$ for the parametric system $x(t)=t^2$ and $y(t) = t^2+6t+5$
2. A Curve $C$ is defined by the parametric equation $x(t) = t^2+t-1$ and $y(t) = t^3-t^2$. Find an equation to the tangent line to $C$ at the point where $t=2$.
3. Find the points of horizontal and vertical tangency to $x(t)=t+5$, $y(t) = t^2-4t$.
4. Write an integral expression for the arc length of $x(t) = e^{2t}$ and $y(t) = 3t-1$ over the interval $-2 \leq t \leq 2$
