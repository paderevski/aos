# Vector functions Quiz 1

The position of a particle at any time $t \geq 0$ is given by $x(t) = t^2 - 2, y(t) = \frac23 t^3$

1. Find the magnitude of the velocity vector at $t=2$.
2. Set up but do not evaluate an integral expression to calculate the total distance
traveled by the particle from $t=0$ to $t=4$.
3. Find $\dfrac{dy}{dx}$ as a function of $t$ and also as a function of $x$.
4. At what time $t$ is the particle on the $y$-axis? What is its acceleration vector at that time?
