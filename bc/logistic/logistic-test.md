### Logistic

1. A population has a growth equation modeled by $P'(t) = P(1-\dfrac{P}{4000})$. What is $\lim_{t \to \infty}P(t)$
2. A population growth model is given by $P(t) = \dfrac{3200}{1+be^{-kt}}$ for $t \geq 0$. If the initial population at $t=0$ is 1200, what is the value of $b$?
3. A population is modeled by logistic growth. Its population growth rate increases until the population is 512 and then the growth rate begins decreasing. Write a differential model for this population in the form of an equation for $\dfrac{dP}{dt}$. Your final answer *may* include undetermined constants, if that is appropriate.
4. A population $P(t)$ is modeled by logistic growth when $t \geq 0$, with a maximum population  of 450 and an initial population of 300. Which of the following could be a graph of $P''(t)$ for $t \geq 0$?
5. A logistic growth model approximates a population's growth for the year range 1900-2000. If the initial population is 400 and the population after 20 years is 500, write an equation to model the population as a function of $t$, where $t$ is "number of years since 1900."
